  "summary": "Frontend changes implement an authentication guard on Checkout and improve toast messaging for placeOrder failures. The backend diff shows a new authenticated-user assertion helper and user profile management, but the truncated backend snippet does not provide clear evidence that cart/order authorization for authenticated non-admin users (getCart/calculateCartTotal/placeOrder and related queries) was updated as required, while keeping admin-only methods gated.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-21",
      "requirement": "Fix backend authorization so authenticated (non-anonymous) customers can call user-scoped checkout methods (getCart, calculateCartTotal, placeOrder, and related cart/order queries) without “user not registered”/authorization errors, while keeping admin-only protections unchanged; anonymous callers should still be rejected with a clear English error.",
      "reason": "The backend diff snippet shows a new `assertAuthenticatedUser` helper, but the provided truncated content does not show changes to `getCart`, `calculateCartTotal`, `placeOrder`, or related cart/order query methods to ensure authenticated non-admin users are treated as valid users and anonymous callers are rejected with clear English errors. Admin-gating integrity for order/product admin methods also can’t be verified from the truncated portion.",

        "backend/main.mo (truncated; does not show updated cart/order methods)"
